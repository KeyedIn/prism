```bash
# Initialize a new component directory for a component named "send-customer-invoices"
prism components:init send-customer-invoices
```

By providing a path to a local WSDL definition file, Prism is able to generate a component that translates the API methods available into Component Actions.
First run the init command and provide a path to the WSDL file.

```bash
prism components:init --wsdl-path ./example.wsdl Example WSDL
# Next navigate into the created directory and install/build the Component with NPM or Yarn
yarn install && yarn build
# Finally publish your WSDL Component
prism components:publish
```
