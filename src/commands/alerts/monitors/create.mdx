:::note Alert Monitors and Alert Groups
While individual users and webhooks can be tied to alert monitors, it is recommended that you create [alert groups](#alertsgroupscreate) and attach alert groups to alert monitors. This helps in the case that you need to add a user to a set of monitors: it's simpler to edit a single alert group than to edit dozens of alert monitors.

```bash
# Create an alert monitor for an instance named "My Instance"
# and alert the "DevOps" group in the event that an
# instance execution takes longer than 10 seconds.
prism alerts:monitors:create \
    --name "Alert Devops of slow execution" \
    --instance $(prism instances:list \
                    --columns id \
                    --filter 'name=^My Instance$' \
                    --no-header) \
    --triggers "[\"$(prism alerts:triggers:list \
                    --columns id \
                    --filter 'name=^Execution Duration Matched or Exceeded$' \
                    --no-header)\"]" \
    --duration 10 \
    --groups "[\"$(prism alerts:groups:list \
                    --columns id \
                    --filter 'name=^DevOps$' \
                    --no-header)\"]"
```
