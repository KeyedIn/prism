Register for access to the API via OAuth2. Authenticated users have higher
rate limits than anonymous users. Additionally, by identifying yourself,
you can request Creative Commons to adjust your personal rate limit
depending on your organization's needs.

Upon registering, you will receive a 'client_id` and `client_secret`, which
you can then use to authenticate using the standard OAuth2 Client
Credentials flow. You must keep `client_secret` confidential; anybody with
your `client_secret` can impersonate your application.

Example registration and authentication flow:

First, register for a key.
```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "My amazing project", "description": "To access CC Catalog API", "email": "cccatalog-api@creativecommons.org"}' https://api.creativecommons.engineering/v1/auth_tokens/register
{
"client_secret" : "YhVjvIBc7TuRJSvO2wIi344ez5SEreXLksV7GjalLiKDpxfbiM8qfUb5sNvcwFOhBUVzGNdzmmHvfyt6yU3aGrN6TAbMW8EOkRMOwhyXkN1iDetmzMMcxLVELf00BR2e",
"client_id" : "pm8GMaIXIhkjQ4iDfXLOvVUUcIKGYRnMlZYApbda",
"name" : "My amazing project"
}

```

Now, exchange your client credentials for a token.
```
$ curl -X POST -d "client_id=pm8GMaIXIhkjQ4iDfXLOvVUUcIKGYRnMlZYApbda&client_secret=YhVjvIBc7TuRJSvO2wIi344ez5SEreXLksV7GjalLiKDpxfbiM8qfUb5sNvcwFOhBUVzGNdzmmHvfyt6yU3aGrN6TAbMW8EOkRMOwhyXkN1iDetmzMMcxLVELf00BR2e&grant_type=client_credentials" https://api.creativecommons.engineering/v1/auth_tokens/token/
{
"access_token" : "DLBYIcfnKfolaXKcmMC8RIDCavc2hW",
"scope" : "read write groups",
"expires_in" : 36000,
"token_type" : "Bearer"
}
```

Check your email for a verification link. After you have followed the link,
your API key will be activated.

Include the `access_token` in the authorization header to use your key in
your future API requests.

```
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer DLBYIcfnKfolaXKcmMC8RIDCavc2hW" https://api.creativecommons.engineering/v1/images?q=test
```

**Be advised** that your token will be throttled like an anonymous user
until the email address has been verified.
